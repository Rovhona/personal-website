              I'm a passionate Computer Science Honours student with a strong foundation in full-stack development, machine learning, and cloud computing. 
              I've applied my skills through internships, tutoring roles, and hackathons â€” including building an AI-powered health tech platform during the 
              Standard Bank Unihack. As the Treasurer of Geekulcha UWC, I also enjoy fostering a thriving local tech community. My goal is to keep creating 
              innovative, user-focused solutions while growing as a developer and problem solver.
